PCA | ICA
------------ | -------------
find an orthogonal linear transformation that maximizes the variance of variables | find the linear transformation, which the basis vectors are statistically independent and non-Gaussian
basis vectors are orthogonal and ranked in order | basis vectors are neither orthogonal nor ranked in order
obtain the most important characteristics from data | find new components (new space) that are mutually independent in complete statistical sense
